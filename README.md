## Design Sprint

This project is the second project of the Udacity Design Sprint Nonodegree Program. 

Apply Design Sprint process for a company called "Ooup" which is an online scooter rental company. 

The first day of the Design Sprint is all about defining the challenge and producing solutions. Finish Day 1 by creating a solution to solve the team's challenge.
Project: The Concept

This day is all about voting on the solutions presented from the first day, deciding which direction to go in, and then creating a detailed Storyboard for the testable Prototype.
Project: The Storyboard

The Prototype creation is vital to the Design Sprint process. Learn how a Sprint team delegates tasks, and identifies key screens from the Storyboard. And finally, you'll get to create an interactive Prototype that will be tested on Day 4.
Project: The Prototype

Learn how to prepare for, conduct, and collect feedback from user-testing of your Prototype on Day 4. And finally, get tips on how to best approach writing a Summary Report of your findings that contains actionable next steps for the Sprint team.
